## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require icetalker/filament-table-repeater
```

You can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-table-repeater"
```

## Usage

```php
use Icetalker\FilamentTableRepeater\Forms\Components\TableRepeater;

protected function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form->schema([
        ...
        TableRepeater::make('items')
                ->relationship('items')
                ->schema([
                    Forms\Components\TextInput::make('product'),
                    ...
                ])
                ->reorderable()
                ->cloneable()
                ->collapsible()
                ->minItems(3)
                ->maxItems(5)
                ->columnSpan('full'),

    ]);
}
```

> Since this component extends from `Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater`, you can use most of its methods, except for a few methods like `inset()`, `grid()`, `columns()`. 

## Other methods

### colStyles

To customize styles for each cell, you can pass an array of component name as key and css style as value to `colStyles()`.  See example below:

```php
use Icetalker\FilamentTableRepeater\Forms\Components\TableRepeater;

protected function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form->schema([
        ...
        Forms\Components\Grid::make(1)->schema([

            TableRepeater::make('items')
                ->relationship('items')
                ->schema([
                    Forms\Components\TextInput::make('product'),
                    Forms\Components\TextInput::make('quantity'),
                    ...
                ])
                ->colStyles([
                    'product' => 'color: #0000ff; width: 250px;',
                ]),

        ]),

    ]);
}
```

Besides, you can also pass a callback function to `colStyles()`. This may unlock more customization possibilities. See example below:

```php
use Icetalker\FilamentTableRepeater\Forms\Components\TableRepeater;

protected function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            ...
            Forms\Components\Grid::make(1)->schema([

                TableRepeater::make('items')
                    ->relationship('items')
                    ->schema([
                        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('product'),
                        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('quantity'),
                        ...
                    ])
                    ->colStyles(function(){
                        return [
                            'product' => 'color: #0000ff; width: 250px;',
                        ]
                    }),

            ]),

        ]);
}
```

## Style customization

Besides the `colStyles()` method mentioned above, we use few css classes to provide extra ability for style customization. These classes were so called CSS "hook" classes. They are prefixed with `it-`(short for `icetalker`, which is the vendor name). Although we already have hook classes in old version, it's never been documented here. And for now, we rename these hook name by the new prefix `it-`:

- `it-table-repeater` instead of `filament-table-repeater` in old version: As what you can tell from the class name, it allows you to customize the style for the whole table.
- `it-table-repeater-cell-label` instead of `filament-table-repeater-header-cell` in old version: As what you can tell from the class name, it allows you to customize the style for the label of each column.
- `it-table-repeater-cell` instead of `filament-table-repeater-tbody-cell` in old version: As what you can tell from the class name, it allows you to customize the style for the cell of each column.
- `it-table-repeater-row`. This is new hook class, so that you can customize the style for each row. 
- `it-table-repeater-label`. A new hook class, so that you can customize the style for item labels on each row.

You may add CSS to these classes in your `app.css` file, and filled with your own styles like this:

```css
.it-table-repeater-cell-label {
    background-color: #fafafa;
}
```
